## üß† Project Workflow

1. **Data Collection**  
   - Acquired movie metadata including titles, genres, overviews, cast, and crew.

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Cleaned and merged relevant features, handled null values.

3. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Combined genres, keywords, cast, and director into one feature.

4. **Vectorization**  
   - Used `CountVectorizer` to convert text data into numerical vectors.

5. **Similarity Calculation**  
   - Used **Cosine Similarity** to measure similarity between movies.

6. **Recommendation Logic**  
   - Top 5 similar movies are selected and shown to the user.

7. **Poster Integration**  
   - Fetched movie posters via **TMDb API** using movie IDs.

8. **Web UI with Streamlit**  
   - Simple dropdown-based interface to select and view recommended movies.
